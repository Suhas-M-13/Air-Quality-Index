# Air Quality Index Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) for a specific city using historical data. The dataset is obtained from the OpenWeather API and is processed using machine learning algorithms to predict AQI based on various atmospheric and environmental factors.

## Features

- **Random Forest Regressor**: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.
- **XGBoost Regressor**: An optimized gradient boosting algorithm designed for high performance and speed.
